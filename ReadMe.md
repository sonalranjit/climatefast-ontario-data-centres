# Ontario Data Centre Directory

## About

Organized by Climatefast, this project aims to make information on all data centres in Ontario accessible. For each data centre, we aim to plot the location on a map, along with key data related to the climate impact it has, related documents, and articles.

## Code overview
The data-analysis folder contains all scripts used to gather, clean, analyze, and prepare the data for use in the application. The data used is not uploaded, please contact me for the data.

The data-centre-directory folder contains the Next.js application.
